# Distracted-Movement-Detection
- The objective is to recognize and monitor the student's (user's) head position and movements, including **looking right**, **looking left**, **looking up**, and **looking down**, to prevent cheating during the exam. (in this case, System Run) 
- This system was developed using `Python` as the programming language, incorporating the `mediapipe` library for detecting facial key points, and leveraging the `OpenCV` library for estimating the head's pose.
